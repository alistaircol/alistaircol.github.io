In other words, I like to tinker. Web Apps/Toys Over the years I have sarted many projects and the majority were never completed or launched at any level outside personal or very limited use, but I can not let them die and have a very slim chance of being revived. Some projects include: mdbin : Created in April 2015 and ran until October 2016, this was a pastebin like site with Markdown rendering, options upon creation include time expiry and password protection option. This was used mostly by myself and between a group of students for University of work. I experimented with using SQLite in this project. Youtube Downloader : I started this in late 2014 due to a friend having no internet access, this would allow the user to add multiple links to vide page and it would download the highest quality available (allowing the files to be moved to external storage device and watched later), a unique part of this is it would handle playlists. ID Depot : A web based system I developed for a client in late 2014 for creating, updating and renewing ID cards in organisations. Travian Helper : A collection of tools and calculators for the relatively simple browser strategy game \"Travian\", this was actually used by a decent number of users from mid 2013 until early 2015 when I lost interest in the game due to significant changes, which made the site less relevant now. This was written in OOP PHP and MySQL. minecraft-skin-viewer : I created this website initally in May 2013 during my time at College for a side project, it was popular enough to give me regular pocket money from ads on the site. I sold the website and domain in August 2014 and has been running successfully for 5 years since. TravianX : I was an active contributor (late 2011 to mid 2013) to an open source clone of a MMORTS game, 'Travian'. I played this game for a long time and found this project, this project which got me into programming and web development. I'd go on to create other projects based on this game later.
